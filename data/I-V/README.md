Current-Voltage Measurements
============================

Machine: Agilent 4156C Precision Semiconductor Parameter Analyzer
-0.5 V to 0.5 V with steps of 10mV 

Description of a Sample
-----------------------
A steel plate with ZrO2 layers has been sputtered through a mask to produce dots of 
aluminium indicated by the zeros (0) in the depiction. On the left and right edge the 
ZrO2 layers have been scratched of and a silver paste has been applied. A single 
IV-curve has been measured by contacting on a aluminium dot and on the right silver 
contact patch

Steps for evaluation:
    - calculate Conductance (G) from IV-curve
    - calculate gamma and phd from G for each sample
