EVALUATION OF ONE SAMPLE
For every I-V curve (aluminium dot) the gradient $g$ at V=0 is calculated by taking 5 points after the origin and 5 points before the origin, averaging their V and I values and calculating i
\begin{math}
g = \frac{I_{n+1} - I_n}{V_{n+1} - V_n}.
\end{math}
As a measure of conductance a distance D from an ideal non-conducting case. The average of the negative base 10 logarithm subtracted from an ideal non-conducting gradient of 10**-13 
\begin{math}
D = \sum_i^N \frac{ -log_{10}(g) - 13}{N}
\end{math}
Another measure is the density of shorted species $\rho_{s}$ is calculated in following way:
\begin{equation}
	s = \begin{cases}
			1 &\text{if} -log(g) < 5 \\
			0 &\text{if} -log(g) \geq 5 \\
		\end{cases}
\rho_s = \sum_i^N \frac{s}{N}
\end{equation}
