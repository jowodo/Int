\subsubsection{what is best}
\begin{align}
%    G    & = -3.7 + 0.18 * TCal +  8.1 * max(0,6-layr)\\
%    \rho & = -0.78 + 0.0024 * TCal + 0.13 * max(0,6-layr)
    G &=      -19 + 0.28 * TCal  - 0.022 * layr*TCal  +  0.16 * h(layr-6)*TDOC \\
    \rho &=  -0.87 + 0.0047 * TCal  - 0.00036 * layr*TCal  +  0.0024 * h(layr-6)*TDOC \\
    \lambda &=  6.8 - 0.014 * TCal  + 0.0018 * layr*TCal  + 0.0060 * h(layr-6)*TDOC \\
    v_{cal} &= 29 - 0.052 * TCal  + 0.0011 * layr*TCal  -  0.011 * h(layr-6)*TDOC

\subsubsection{how did model selection influence results}
The heating rate of the calcination process $v_{cal}$ and the number of layers $\lambda$ were included as dependent variable with the objective to maximize with a relative weight of 0.05.
The idea was to maximize $v_{cal}$ and minimize $\lambda$ in order to minimize the process time. 
Another thought behind including $v_{cal}$ and $\lambda$ was to test if the alogrithm would correctly predict those. 
Two major flaws behind this flaws became obvious with time: 
(1) The algorithm would be influenced by those values to choose samples, which potenitally optimize $v_{cal}$ and/or $\lambda$ but not $G$ or $\rho$. 
Neben making the problem unnoetiger weise more complicate, important time (around 10\% of the samples) could have been replaced with more insighful samples. 
(2) The true function for predicting $v_{cal}$ and $\lambda$ are $v_cal*60$ ($C/h$ instead of $C/min$) and $\lambda$, respectively. 
The algorithm will tend to include thos values into the prediction function for all dependent variables and possibly exclude others which have more influence on $G$ and $\rho$ (see \ref{eq:emma}).
\begin{itemize}
    \item MARS chooses same set from independent variables for predicting all dependent variables. 
    \item flaws of MARS: all functions are dependent on same indep vars
    \item Every output var is independent of each other, so $v_{cal}$ can act as test 
heating rate was one of the dependent variables with the intention of minimizing the variable. 
It can also be used as test to see how well the EMMA performes (or rather, more precisely MARS)
It doesn't influence the fit for the other splines, but it influences the choice of samples therefore it might have slowed down the process
Overall there were too many variables involved for such a small dataset
        that means that adding dependent variables influences \td{previous variables}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{analyse data with other methods post optimization}
Anova shows that the influence of TCal is significant as shown by the F 
\begin{itemize}
    \item ANOVA (influence of TCal) \texttt{Code/Statistics/sub/anova.R}
    \item lin regression (influence of conc) \texttt{Code/Statistics/sub/linreg.py}
    \item grid search 
    \item KRR (???)
    \item SVM (???)
\end{itemize}
