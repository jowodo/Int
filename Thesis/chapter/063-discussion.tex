\subsubsection{Research, exploration and design phase}
\label{sec:phase1}
\td{freewriting}: \textbf{Scrutinize everthing!} At the beginning of a project it is importatnt 
to get a feel. I took the first recipe as only true recipe and tried to tune it to perfection. 
The problem was that the base line of that recipe was so low such that no matter how much I improved it, it was still bad. 
I only noticed this after trying out another recipe. 
My tipp here is to read as much and mostly diverse literature as possible and then try to mimic what ever you can. 
This will get you a "feel" of what works and what not. 
Thinking back to some design classes I took for data visualization: create as many and different designs as possible. 
Check what works, collect (dis-)advantages of methods and combine the best approaches. 
This can save you a lot of time. 

Moreover, it is important to define the objective of the project as clear and disambiguous as possible. 
Again, try to reformulate the objective in mutliple ways and choose the most fitting. 
Answer which question should be answered, and establish hypotheses with corresponding null hypotheses. 
A general experimental procedure was stated by Cherkassky and Mulier\cite{cherkassky1998learning}:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{State the problem}
    \item \textbf{Formulate the hypothesis}
    \item \textbf{Design the experiment/data generation process}
    \item \textbf{Collect the data and perform preprocessing}
    \item \textbf{Estimate the model}
    \item \textbf{Interpret the model/draw the conclusion}
\end{enumerate}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%55
\iffalse
\begin{itemize}
    \item The most time consuming part was definitively the prelaminary studies. this time could have been verk√ºrzt by testing a wide array of diverse recipes from the literature
    \item minimize prelaminary study time by testing a wide range of designs. scrutinize (hinterfragen) everything!
    \item \textbf{planning} gives chance of zooming out and force oneself to get an overview and to decide how much time on each task
    \item \textbf{research} phase is most important, dig into basics, discuss ideas with colleagues or go into detail about plan. Understand details of methods. Make a dummy run. Collect (dis-)advantages of different methods. Like in design project: do as many and as diverse solutions as possbile. Compare and combine the best parts. Reading will let learn from others mistakes. \\ \td{longer literature research (first solution,second solution) and PSO wrongly eingeschaetzt, could have been verhindert durch lesen the docu and more papers more thoughoughly. Ich war geblendet von dem was ich wollte und dadurch nicht realistisch}
    \item \textbf{objective} should be defined as clear as possible. It will help to set a clear goal for each todo, e.g. the primary goal of a screening experiment is to identify the active factors.\cite{miller2001using} Which question should be answered and aufstellen a null Hypothesis. This is often very trivial, but let's you focus on the correct path. 
    \item what was goal of incorporating ml into this work? 
%\td{The goal of introducing \gls{ml} to this project was to apply and delve/vertiefen into subject which I've been studying during my undergrad courses. This seemed like the perfect opputrunity. And indeed I learned a lot. Even if only although \gls{ml} is a hot topic at the moment, it can not solve every problem. Two important things have I learned regarding \gls{ml}: 
\end{itemize}
General experimental procedure from Cherkassky and Mulier Learning from Data\cite{cherkassky1998learning}:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{State the problem}
    \item \textbf{Formulate the hypothesis}
    \item \textbf{Design the experiment/data generation process}
    \item \textbf{Collect the data and perform preprocessing}
    \item \textbf{Estimate the model}
    \item \textbf{Interpret the model/draw the conclusion}
\end{enumerate}
\iffalse
\textbf{1. Statement of the Problem} There was no clear statement of the problem. Now I would formulate it: "How to produce most insulating layer with least energy? How do we define most insulating?" That's why there are two output variables rather than one.
\textbf{2. Hypothesis Formulation} formulate an unknown dependency and define input and output variables.
\textbf{3. Data Generation and Experiment Design} can be either in control of the modeler (designed experiment) or in an observational setting. The data collection can affect the sampling distribution and influence the next steps. 
\textbf{4. Collect the Data and Perform Preprocessing} here outliers are detected and data preprocessing/encoding/feature selection. Scaling by standard deviation might be a good idea, but independent scaling of variables can lead to suboptimal representation for the learning task. Feature selection: A small number of informative features make the task of estimating dependencies easier. 
\textbf{5. Model Estimation} The main goal is to construct a model for accurate prediction of future outputs
\textbf{6. Interpret the Model and Drawing Conclusions} The interpretability and accuracy of the model are compete. In classical statistics such as linearly parametrized function will suit both requirements. More complex and flexible models might lead to better estimates with less interpretability. Identifying the most important input variables. \cite{cherkassky1998learning}

\subsubsection{Narrowing, pre-optimisation and constraint phase}
\label{sec:phase2}
After having decided on a base recipe, it is important to define limits and decrease the number of independent varibles. 
The later is more important due to the curse of dimensionality\cite{cherkassky1998learning}, 
which states that with increasing dimensionality it get exponentially more difficult to arrive at the same density of datapoints. 
By excluding input variables from the model 
the complexity of the model can be drastically reduced. 
This leads to more information which can be extrated from the remaining data, 
be it in more detail of the dependence or higher confidence interval. 
A good measure to compare with literature and other methods is the \gls{epv}. 
In this work there around 5~\gls{epv}, which is pretty low. 
This is ofcourse not just as straight forward as suggested. 
How does one decide which variables to keep and which to incorporate into the model and which to discard? 
There is the intuitive (expert) way and the mathematical way.
mathematical ways include: pca, step-wise regression 
%
Additionally having wide limit can be an advantage when the data is noisy and the dependence is not too complicated.
"By moving the samples to the boundaries of the design space, the effect of the random term is reduced\cite{giunta2003overview}."
%
There are two opposing principles which can be followed: 
By introducing a lot of variables into a model presupposes that they and their interactions (!) have a statistically significant effect.\cite{gunst2009fractional}.
On the other hand a model can be used to tell if a variable exerts an influence. 
%
One regime where overfitting occurs is when there are to many parameters to be fitted with not enough data. 
Overfitting happens in the regime where to many parameters are fitted with not enough data. 
%
Another step/deed which is well placed in this phase is the estimating the error by reproducing a singel sample a certain number of times. 
Where the number will then be higher than during optimisation 
\todo{include curse of dimensionality.}

%\td{This section is about 3. DAta Generation and Experiment Design from cherkessky's list. }
\begin{itemize}
    \item Dimension reduction bietet sich stark an bei solcher Datenlage. in pre-optimisation!
    \item \textbf{keep it simple}: include what you already know and reduce model size to minimum, such that \gls{epv} is high.  Low \gls{epv} leads to low statistical significance, especially if the error is realtively large. (confere orig papers)
%\td{In example of documentation 2 input variables and 1-2 responses initial population=10
%, subsequent population=5, but 10 iterations. Clearly more input varibles and less 
%iterations (as in actual experiments) lead to suboptimal results.}
    \item \textbf{pre-optimisation}{The primary goal of a screening experiment is to identify the active factors. A secondary goal is to provide a simple model that captures the essential features of the relationship between these active factors and the response‚Äîthat is, to identify the active effects. \cite{miller2001using}} But $2^6=64$ are too many for preliminary test so maybe check base and from there do $2\cdot6=12$ experiments. Then focus on selected input vars, which might have mutliple maxima \\ \td{pre optimization was used to check if limits where okay, but could also have been used to sieve out factors without impact on response (see miller 2001 \cite{miller2001using} section 1) }
    \item \textbf{factorial design} (classical \gls{doe}) is more robust at feature extraction for error laden data \cite{giunta2003overview} putting data on the extrems makes trend extraction easier. "By moving the samples to the boundaries of the design space, the effect of the random error terms is reduced."
    \item only include relevant variables\cite{gunst2009fractional}, but include all variables which could contribute\cite{haertler2014statistisch}
%-\td{"Similarly, it is often wise not to plan a comprehensive experiment that involves a large number of factors of interest. Such an experiment presupposes that most or all of the factors are important contributors to changes in the response variable and that they contribute jointly; i.e., that individual factor effects and their interactions are statistically significant and meaningful." - from Gunst2009}
%but on the other hand: If one ain't sure a if factor is relevant, the model should be able to detect if there is a influence. - from Haertler2014?
    \item which input variables could have been left out? why? justify with intuition and maths
    \item selection of in- and output vars is more important than coice of learning algorithm. 
%The process informal part of selection of input and output variables, data encoding/representation and incorporating a prior knowledge into the design of the learning system is often more critical for an overall success than the design of the learning machine itself.\cite{cherkassky1998learning} (page 25)

\subsubsection{Optimisation, modelling and data generation}
\label{sec:phase3}
During the optimisation the main problems were too many in- and output variables, reproducability and regularisation. The first, problem was already discussed in the previous section. When working with stochastic algorithms it is especially important to be introduce reproducability via a seed, which determine all subsequent pseudo-random numbers. 
Finally, during the \gls{emma} optimisation es wurde auf regularisation verzichtet, 
because the regularization would be different 
because regularizing with the meand and std deviation would alter previous messurements, which alread beitragen to the model and the influence the decision of the next sample. 
On the other hand haette man auf jeden fall die input variablen normieren k√∂nnen. 
Normally, for standardisation the mean is substracted and it is devided by the standard deviation, which impplies a distribution of a random variable. 
One could have assumed a standard uniform distribution. 
rather $x'= \frac{x-\bar{x}}{x_{max} - \bar{x}}$ with $\bar{x}= x_{\text{max}} - x_{\text{min}}$
\begin{itemize}
    \item regularization
    \item reproducability (random in code and repeat sample)
    \item main problems too many in and output vars
%\td{two main problems: 1. too many input variables; 2. too many output varibales; at2: as some input variables were also output variables, MARS couldnt find correct BFs. This could be used though: use input var also as output var if you think they are inportant, this way they will be more likely to be choosen in basis function}

    \item why $\gamma ~ \lambda$? (minimum for layer count?) according which eq? emma?

%Issues of methods for learning from data: 
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item How to incorporate a priori assumptions into learning? 
%	\item How to measure model complexity (i.e. flexibility to fit the training data)?
%	\item How to find a optimal balance between the data and a priori knowledge? 
%\end{itemize}
%\cite{cherkassky1998learning}
%"Learning is the process of estimating an unkown (input,output) dependency of structure of a system using a limit number of observations."\cite{cherkassky1998learning}
%"Do not attempt to solve a specified problem by indirectly solving a harder general problem as an intermediate step."\cite{cherkassky1998learning}(p33)
%"This approach works well only when the number of training samples is large relative to the (prespecified) model complexity (or the number of free parameters)".\cite{cherkassky1998learning}(p41)
%Modeling bias in statistics is the discrepancy of the mismatch between parametric assumptions and the true dependency.
%Modeling bias is overcome by using very flexible approximation function, with the tradeoff of more complex inductive (learning) steps. 
%Any learning process requires the following(p40): 
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item A (wide, flexible) set of approximating functions $\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x},\omega),\; \omega \in \Omega$
%	\item A priori knowledge to impose contrains
%	\item An inductive principle (what needs to be done)
%		\begin{itemize}
%			\item penalizeation (regularization) inductive principle
%			\item early stopping rules (with ANN, difficult to control and interpret)
%			\item structural risk minimization (SRM) (order according to complexity)
%			\item Bayesian Inference (add subjectivity to learning machine)
%			\item Minimum Description Length (MDL, cryptic complicated uninteresting)

%	\item A learning method (how does it need to be done,implementation)
