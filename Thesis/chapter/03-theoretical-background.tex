give some introduction on methods used during experimental and \td{analytical} phase of this work. 
\subsection{Photovoltaics}
\iffalse
The grundlage for all pvs is the photovoltaik effect which was entdeckt by Albert Einstein adn for which he got the nobel price. 
The Prinziple is easy: When the energy (E = hv) of the light is \td{large,strong,high}er 
than the binding energy of an electron the electron is ejected with the remaining energy as kinetic energy 
\begin{math}
	E_{kin}=hv - Eb
\end{math}
Different Materials have different binding energies. 
Metals do have in general lower binding energies than covalent bound material and semiconductors do have even lowers E_b. Really? 
That's Silica is in a lot of PVs. 
The next generation of PVs. 
CIGS has in contrast to silicon based PV a direct band gap\td{source and what does that mean?}

\subsubsection{Problems of current energy supply}
The world wide energy consumption has more than doubled between 1970 and 2015\cite{BP2017} 
and according to recent studies both fossil\cite{BGR2017} and uranium sources\cite{Uran2006} 
will be exhausted within the next 100 years. 
%This time period must of course taken with a grain of salt as it can happen that even though the resource are being exhausted they can rise from one year to another as new reserves are being discovered and explored. 
Even though this time period is not exact and highly dependent on detection methods, 
this number is rather small and brings us in zugzwang. 

\subsubsection{History of Photovoltaics}

The photoelectric effect was first described in 1839 by french scientist Alexandre Edmond Becquerel\cite{becquerel1839memoire}, the father of Henri Becquerel. 
With the discovery of photo conductivity of selenium
%the correlation between the {change of the }resistance and the irradiating light 
by British engineer Willouhgby Smith\cite{Smith1873Selenium} 
%and his assistant Joseph May 
another relevant piece of the photovoltaic jigsaw was discovered. 
In 1876 William Adams and Richard Day\cite{Adams1876Selenium} showed that 
the energy of light can be directly converted into electrical energy by a bar of 
selenium with attached platinum electrodes.
And finally, in 1905 Einstein described the physical background of the photoelectric 
effect with his light quantum theory\cite{einstein1905erzeugung}.
In the 1950s the first solar cells (with efficiencies under 10 percent) were used in niche applications such as space flight. 
Eventually, the interest in photovoltaic and other alternative energy sources 
rose - fuelled by the oil crisis in 1973 - 
and the development of photovoltaic for the consumer market was boosted. \\

\subsection{CIGS}
%%%
%Materials from the chalcopyrite group (tetragonal crystal system) (eg CuInGaSe(CIGS)) can be used as absorber in such thin film cells.
CIGS ($\text{CuIn}_\text{x}\text{Ga}_{\text{(1-x)}}\text{Se}_2$) is of the chalcopyrite group (tetragonal crystal system) and can be used as thin film PV. 
Just like CdTe, GaAs and amorphoous silicon CIGS have much higher absorption coeffiecients 
(lower penetration depth) of visible light than crystlline silicon (see table \ref{tab:cigs:alpha}). 
These thin film PVs not only use less material, but also can be used in flexible applications. 
%%%
%Amorphous silicon and copper indium selenide (CIS) \td{(see next chapter)} have much higher absorption coefficients of visible light than crystalline silicon (see table \ref{tab:cigs:alpha}) and can therefore be much thinner and use less material. 
%Another advantage of thin film cells is that they can be used in flexible applications. 
%which because of their high absorption coefficient of light %and therefore shallow penetration depth of light%need less material and can be used to produce flexible cells \\%of amorph silicon or CIS (see table p84)

%The awesome thing about CIGS is that the band gap can be varied by between 1eV and 1.7eV by varying the inidum gallium ratio accordingly. 
The band gap of CIGS can be varied by between 1eV and 1.7eV by varying the inidum gallium ratio.
This is a result of the large difference of band gaps of CuInSe2 and CuGaSe2 (see table \ref{tab:cigs}).

%Because of the large difference of band gaps of CuInSe2 and CuGaSe2 the band gap can be configured by mixing ratio of inidum and gallium (see table \ref{tab:cigs}).

\subsection{Zirconium oxide}
Zirconium oxide \td{(ZrO2)} is ceramic with a bandgap of 5-7 eV and dielectric constant of 15-22\cite{Anwar2017}. 
This makes it attractive as an insulator for semiconductor and \td{PV} industry. 
It is monoclinic below 1170 °C, tetragonal between 1170 °C and 2370 °C, and cubic above 2370 °C\cite{Stevens1986}.

%Sputtering is a physical deposition method. 
Sputtering describes the process of particles being sputtered from a surface after 
impact of highly energetic particles.
These high energy particles start cascades of momentum transfers. 
If a path of a cascade reaches back to the surface and the kinetic energy of a surface 
particle exceeds the binding energy, it is ejected (or sputtered).

%Sputtering describes the process when highly energetic particles collide with a surface 
%and through a cascade of momentum transfers surface particles are depleted and sputter from the surface.
This process occurs naturally in outer space (through alpha particles, electrons etc.) 
and is used in science and technology for 
sputter cleaning, thin film deposition, analysis or etching. 
The phenomenon was discovered and identified as an atomic collision phenomenon in the 
middle of the 20th century and now is a field of research with its own niche subfields 
(e.g. sputtering of exotic materials (such as condensed gases, planetary
atmospheres, lunar dust grains, proteins and viruses), high density cascades and 
linear cascades, which could be called classical sputtering)
%sputtering of insulators and biomolecular material)
\cite{Sigmund1987}.
%
In this work it was used to deposit thin gold contacts through a mask. 
A directional current sputtering machine was used. 
\td{describe the machine}
A argon plasma in a strong electrical field (some kV) provides the highly energetic particles. 
Argon ions are accelerated through the field to the source (a metal wafer), which acts as cathode, and start cascades. 
In order to maximise the yield (sputtering speed) a magnet is used to trap the plasma close to source.

SPUTTERING FREEWRITING: 
what is sputtering? \\
sputtering is the processes of highly energetic ions (only ions?) hitting a surface and atoms or molecules being expelled. 
This is a physical vapor deposition technique (PVD). PVD can be unterteils in thermal and highly energetic activated. Sputtering is part of HEA, which hast the convenience, that some substrates don't withstand high temperatures. 
what can it be used for?\\
Sputtering moved from being a curious experiment to having multi anwendungen in science (forschung) and engineering, becuase the sputtered materials can be deposited on  substrate. 
anwendungen reichen from, thin films for PV, electrical circuits, storage media such as CDs and DVDs etc. 
Vorteile of sputtering are also a good adherent to the substrate and good step coverage and what else? 
different styles\\
The most successful durchgesetzte kind of sputtering devices are magnetron sputtering devices, which wiederum can be unterteilt in DC (directional current) RF (radio frequency) sputtering and reactive sputtering. 
how does it work? \\
A high voltage is applied to the source (make skizze), which acts as a cathode. 
The cathode, then, emits electrons which collide with XXX gas (mostly argon because of it's inert properties and potential to transfer more kinetic than lighter noble gases). 
The argon may get ionized by electron and the argon cation will be accelerated to the cathode. If the cation has enough energy it will bump off a target atom or molecule. 
This happens by a cascade of momentum transfers, which can reach the surface again. 
If the suface particle gets momentum pointing from the surface and the remaining kinetic energy is higher then the binding energy, the particle is sputtered. 
The pressure should be small, such that the sputtered particle has a moeglichst long mean free path (MFP), but on the other hand there is a minimum pressure to keep the plasma going. 
Usual pressures are around (1 mPa?).
\td{mention the substrate parallel to the target}

A magnetron can be placed behind the cathode (target) in order to trap ejected ions close to the electron source. 
This prevents high energy electrons from reaching the target and undoing the deposited layer and increasing the probability of an electron colliding with an argon atom and ionizing it
