The recent developments and trends of research in laboratories and industrial achievements communicated within the last years are reviewed, and the major developments linked to alkali post deposition treatment and composition grading in CIGS, surface passivation, buffer, and transparent contact layers are emphasized. Encouraging results have been achieved for CIGS-based tandem solar cells and for improvement in low light device performance. Challenges of technology transfer of lab's record high efficiency cells to average industrial production are obvious from the reported efficiency values. One section is dedicated to development and opportunities offered by flexible and lightweight CIGS modules. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The first part contains a short summary of the results obtained by Professor Adams, which have been communicated to the Society. It has been already shown that the action is due principally, if not entirely, to those rays of the spectrum which are luminous, and that the ultra-red or the ultra-violet rays have little or no effect; also that the intensity of the action depends on the illuminating power of the light, being directly as the square root of that illuminating power. }

abstract = {Chalcopyrites are important contenders among thin-film solar cells due to their direct band gap and higher absorption coefficient. Copper–Indium–Gallium Sulfide (CIGS2) is a chalcopyrite material with a near-optimum band gap of \~1.5eV. Record efficiency of 11.99\% has been achieved on a 2.7μm CIGS2 film prepared by sulfurization at the Florida Solar Energy Center (FSEC) PV Materials Lab. In this work, photovoltaic performance analysis has been carried out for a 1.5μm absorber prepared under similar conditions as that of a 2.7μm thick absorber sample. It was observed that there is an increase in diode factor and reverse saturation current density when the absorber thickness was decreased. The diode factor increased from 1.69 to 2.18 and reverse saturation current density increased from 1.04×10−10mA/cm2 to 1.78×10−8mA/cm2. This can be attributed to a decrease in the grain size when the absorber thickness is decreased. It was also observed that there is an improvement in the shunt resistance. Improvement in shunt resistance can be attributed to optimized value of i:ZnO for lower absorber thickness and less shunting paths due to a smoother absorber.}

abstract = {In this work, the morphology of ZrO2 thin film from dip coating process on mild steel has been investigated. Mild steel was dip-coated on solution made of zirconium butoxide as a precursor, ethanol as solvent, acetylacetone as chelating agent and water for hydrolysis. Number of dipping was adjusted at 3, 5 and 7 times. The dipped sample then annealed at 350°C for two hours by adjusting the heating rate at 1°C/min respectively. The optical microscope showed that micro-cracks were observed on the surface of the coating with its concentration reduced as dipping sequence increased. The XRD result showed that annealing process can produce polycrystalline tetragonal-ZrO2. Meanwhile, SEM image showed that the thicknesses of the ZrO2 coatings were in between 400-600 nm. The corrosion resistance of uncoated and coated substrates was studied by polarization test through potentio-dynamic polarization curve at 1mV/s immersed in with 3.5% NaCl. The coating efficiency was improved as the number of layer dip coated increased, which showed improvement in corrosion protection.}

The results show that, in the solution, acetylacetone (AcAc) and aluminum form a complex compound which effectively suppresses the growth of colloidal particles and makes the sol very stable. Al2O3thin films fabricated by spin-coating method and calcined at 500°C for 3h possess an amorphous structure and exhibit a highly homogeneous surface texture without evidence of holes or cracks throughout the film. Moreover, the prepared films display a low leakage current and a high transmittance. This new sol-gel route appears to be a highly promising method to synthetize dense Al2O3 thin films from Al(OPri)3, and could provide a wide range of optical and electric applications.}

Robustness may be defined as the property of a procedure which renders the answers it gives insensitive to departures, of a kind which occur in practice, from ideal assumptions. Since assumptions imply some kind of scientific model, I believe that it is necessary to look at the process of scientific modelling itself to understand the nature of and the need for robust procedures. Against such a view it might be urged that some useful robust procedures have been derived empirically without an explicitly stated model. However, an empirical procedure implies some unstated model and there is often great virtue in bringing into the open the kind of assumptions that lead to useful methods. The need for robust methods seems to be intimately mixed up with the need for simple models. This we now discuss.}

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the key technologies of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (or Industry 4.0), which can be used for the protection of Internet-connected systems from cyber threats, attacks, damage, or unauthorized access. To intelligently solve today’s various cybersecurity issues, popular AI techniques involving machine learning and deep learning methods, the concept of natural language processing, knowledge representation and reasoning, as well as the concept of knowledge or rule-based expert systems modeling can be used. Based on these AI methods, in this paper, we present a comprehensive view on “AI-driven Cybersecurity” that can play an important role for intelligent cybersecurity services and management. The security intelligence modeling based on such AI methods can make the cybersecurity computing process automated and intelligent than the conventional security systems. We also highlight several research directions within the scope of our study, which can help researchers do future research in the area. Overall, this paper’s ultimate objective is to serve as a reference point and guidelines for cybersecurity researchers as well as industry professionals in the area, especially from an intelligent computing or AI-based technical point of view.},

Only electron microscopy (EM) enables complete, unbiased mapping of synaptic connectivity; however, the fly brain is too large for conventional EM. We developed a custom high-throughput EM platform and imaged the entire brain of an adult female fly at synaptic resolution. To validate the dataset, we traced brain-spanning circuitry involving the mushroom body (MB), which has been extensively studied for its role in learning. All inputs to Kenyon cells (KCs), the intrinsic neurons of the MB, were mapped, revealing a previously unknown cell type, postsynaptic partners of KC dendrites, and unexpected clustering of olfactory projection neurons. These reconstructions show that this freely available EM volume supports mapping of brain-spanning circuits, which will significantly accelerate Drosophila neuroscience.}

Currently under construction, Neom is seeking to integrate robotics and AI seamlessly into every aspect of citizens' lives in a bid to generate revenues from key economic sectors for the future. This transition from an economy based on hydrocarbons to AI is, however, more than economic. It is a bid to secure the survival of the House of Saud and meet the growing challenges of constructing a state around oil. Nevertheless, what happens in Neom may provide insights into how AI will impact the world beyond a cross-roads built on sand.},

Here we introduce a method based on machine learning to overcome this bottleneck and enable accurate photodynamics on nanosecond time scales{,} which are otherwise out of reach with contemporary approaches. Instead of expensive quantum chemistry during molecular dynamics simulations{,} we use deep neural networks to learn the relationship between a molecular geometry and its high-dimensional electronic properties. As an example{,} the time evolution of the methylenimmonium cation for one nanosecond is used to demonstrate that machine learning algorithms can outperform standard excited-state molecular dynamics approaches in their computational efficiency while delivering the same accuracy."

The modern field of AI began at a small summer workshop at Dartmouth College in 1956. Since then, AI applications made possible by machine learning (ML), an AI subdiscipline, include Internet searches, e-commerce sites, goods and services recommender systems, image and speech recognition, sensor technologies, robotic devices, and cognitive decision support systems (DSSs). As more applications are integrated into everyday life, AI is predicted to have a globally transformative influence on economic and social structures similar to the effect that other general-purpose technologies, such as steam engines, railroads, electricity, electronics, and the Internet, have had. Novel AI applications in the workplace of the future raise important issues for occupational safety and health. This commentary reviews the origins of AI, use of ML methods, and emerging AI applications embedded in physical objects like sensor technologies, robotic devices, or operationalized in intelligent DSSs. Selected implications on the future of work arising from the use of AI applications, including job displacement from automation and management of human-machine interactions, are also reviewed. Engaging in strategic foresight about AI workplace applications will shift occupational research and practice from a reactive posture to a proactive one. Understanding the possibilities and challenges of AI for the future of work will help mitigate the unfavorable effects of AI on worker safety, health, and well-being.},

    journal={AI \& SOCIETY},
    pages={715-724},
    volume={36},
    abstract={A humanoid robot named ‘Sophia’ has sparked controversy since it has been given citizenship and has done media performances all over the world. The company that made the robot, Hanson Robotics, has touted Sophia as the future of artificial intelligence (AI). Robot scientists and philosophers have been more pessimistic about its capabilities, describing Sophia as a sophisticated puppet or chatbot. Looking behind the rhetoric about Sophia’s citizenship and intelligence and going beyond recent discussions on the moral status or legal personhood of AI robots, we analyse the performativity of Sophia from the perspective of what we call ‘political choreography’: drawing on phenomenological approaches to performance-oriented philosophy of technology. This paper proposes to interpret and discuss the world tour of Sophia as a political choreography that boosts the rise of the social robot market, rather than a statement about robot citizenship or artificial intelligence. We argue that the media performances of the Sophia robot were choreographed to advance specific political interests. We illustrate our philosophical discussion with media material of the Sophia performance, which helps us to explore the mechanisms through which the media spectacle functions hand in hand with advancing the economic interests of technology industries and their governmental promotors. Using a phenomenological approach and attending to the movement of robots, we also criticize the notion of ‘embodied intelligence’ used in the context of social robotics and AI. In this way, we put the discussions about the robot’s rights or citizenship in the context of AI politics and economics.},

There were a number of factors that contributed to this success, including: •a single-chip chess search engine,•a massively parallel system with multiple levels of parallelism,•a strong emphasis on search extensions,•a complex evaluation function, and•effective use of a Grandmaster game database. This paper describes the Deep Blue system, and gives some of the rationale that went into the design decisions behind Deep Blue.}

Building on the theoretical results of Fedorov (1972, Theory of Optimal Experiments, Academic Press) and MacKay (1992, Neural Computation, 4, 590–604), I apply techniques from optimal experiment design (OED) to guide the query/action selection of a neural network learner. I demonstrate that these techniques allow the learner to minimize its generalization error by exploring its domain efficiently and completely. I conclude that, while not a panacea, OED-based query/action selection has much to offer, especially in domains where its high computational costs can be tolerated.

abstract = {Publisher Summary
This chapter discusses the study of the design of the experimental conditions so that the experiment is maximally informative. For dynamic systems, experiment design includes choice of input and measurement ports, test signals, sampling instants, and presampling filters. Each of these variables has a significant bearing upon the information provided by an experiment. The effects of these variables are, in general, closely interrelated and a joint design is required. Any experimental design must take account the constraints on the allowable experimental conditions. The real purpose of experiment design is to maximize the information content of the data within the limits imposed by the given constraints. In this chapter, the problem of accuracy of estimation is discussed. The input design problem with both input and output power constraints is described in the chapter. The broader problem of coupled design of input, presampling, filters, and sampling times is described in the chapter. It is shown that the choice of experimental conditions (inputs, sampling times, presampling filters, etc.) has a significant effect upon the achievable accuracy. Experiment design procedures in both time and frequency domains are developed.}

Section 2 presents a direct proof and interpretation of the equivalence theorem for the general case of a concave criterion function. This has implications for iterative algorithms of the type suggested by Wynn, as indicated in Section 3. Section 4 is concerned with a characterization of D,-optimality as a criterion which preserves ranking of designs under certain transformations of the problem. Section 5 discusses quasi-linear representations of the criterion for c-optimality.},

	abstract = {The growing power of computers enabled techniques created for design and analysis of simulations to be applied to a large spectrum of problems and to reach high level of acceptance among practitioners. Generally, when simulations are time consuming, a surrogate model replaces the computer code in further studies (e.g., optimization, sensitivity analysis, etc.). The first step for a successful surrogate modeling and statistical analysis is the planning of the input configuration that is used to exercise the simulation code. Among the strategies devised for computer experiments, Latin hypercube designs have become particularly popular. This paper provides a tutorial on Latin hypercube design of experiments, highlighting potential reasons of its widespread use. The discussion starts with the early developments in optimization of the point selection and goes all the way to the pitfalls of the indiscriminate use of Latin hypercube designs. Final thoughts are given on opportunities for future research. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

 abstract = {Box and Hunter (1961) made an important observation that any fractional factorial design of resolution R has the property that when projected onto any R−1 factors it becomes a full factorial design. This has a significant implication for statistical analysis. We observe that the Plackett-Burman and related designs have a hidden projection property with an analogous implication for the analysis. Because of complex aliasing, these designs have traditionally been used for screening main effects only. The hidden projection property suggests that complex aliasing actually allows some interactions to be entertained and estimated without making additional runs and provides an explanation for the success of an analysis strategy due to Hamada and Wu (1992). We give a detailed study of the hidden projection property for 12-run and 20-run designs with two levels and an 18-run design with three levels.},

This concept is discussed in this article in the context of batch distillation column design with feed stock variations, and internal and external uncertainties. Stochastic optimization methods provide a general approach to robust/parameter design as compared to conventional techniques. However, the computational burden of these approaches can be extreme and depends on the sample size used for characterizing the parametric variations and uncertainties. A novel sampling technique is presented that generates and inverts the Hammersley points (an optimal design for placing n points uniformly on a k-dimensional cube) to provide a representative sample for multivariate probability distributions. The example of robust batch-distillation column design illustrates that the new sampling technique offers significant computational savings and better accuracy.},

	abstract = {Abstract Fractional factorial designs are among the most important statistical contributions to the efficient exploration of the effects of several controllable factors on a response of interest. Fractional factorials are widely used in experiments in fields as diverse as agriculture, industry, and medical research. A key feature of fractional factorials that is not shared by more ad hoc methods for reducing the size of experiments is that the statistical properties are known in advance of experimentation. Consequently, an experimenter can investigate alternatives that enable the goals of the experiment to be met with the least cost, shortest time, or most effective use of resources. On occasion, an experimenter might decide not to conduct an experiment as originally planned once the statistical properties of the design are known. This article highlights the fundamental concepts, design strategies, and statistical properties of fractional factorial designs. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.
