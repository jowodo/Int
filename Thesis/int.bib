journal = {{IOP} Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering},
abstract = {In this work, the morphology of ZrO2 thin film from dip coating process on mild steel has been investigated. Mild steel was dip-coated on solution made of zirconium butoxide as a precursor, ethanol as solvent, acetylacetone as chelating agent and water for hydrolysis. Number of dipping was adjusted at 3, 5 and 7 times. The dipped sample then annealed at 350°C for two hours by adjusting the heating rate at 1°C/min respectively. The optical microscope showed that micro-cracks were observed on the surface of the coating with its concentration reduced as dipping sequence increased. The XRD result showed that annealing process can produce polycrystalline tetragonal-ZrO2. Meanwhile, SEM image showed that the thicknesses of the ZrO2 coatings were in between 400-600 nm. The corrosion resistance of uncoated and coated substrates was studied by polarization test through potentio-dynamic polarization curve at 1mV/s immersed in with 3.5% NaCl. The coating efficiency was improved as the number of layer dip coated increased, which showed improvement in corrosion protection.}

	abstract = {Anew sol-gel route has been applied to synthetize dense Al2O3thin films from aluminum isopropoxide (Al(OPri)3)as raw precursor material. The results show that, in the solution, acetylacetone (AcAc) and aluminum form a complex compound which effectively suppresses the growth of colloidal particles and makes the sol very stable. Al2O3thin films fabricated by spin-coating method and calcined at 500°C for 3h possess an amorphous structure and exhibit a highly homogeneous surface texture without evidence of holes or cracks throughout the film. Moreover, the prepared films display a low leakage current and a high transmittance. This new sol-gel route appears to be a highly promising method to synthetize dense Al2O3 thin films from Al(OPri)3, and could provide a wide range of optical and electric applications.}

abstract = {Chalcopyrites are important contenders among thin-film solar cells due to their direct band gap and higher absorption coefficient. Copper–Indium–Gallium Sulfide (CIGS2) is a chalcopyrite material with a near-optimum band gap of ~1.5eV. Record efficiency of 11.99% has been achieved on a 2.7μm CIGS2 film prepared by sulfurization at the Florida Solar Energy Center (FSEC) PV Materials Lab. In this work, photovoltaic performance analysis has been carried out for a 1.5μm absorber prepared under similar conditions as that of a 2.7μm thick absorber sample. It was observed that there is an increase in diode factor and reverse saturation current density when the absorber thickness was decreased. The diode factor increased from 1.69 to 2.18 and reverse saturation current density increased from 1.04×10−10mA/cm2 to 1.78×10−8mA/cm2. This can be attributed to a decrease in the grain size when the absorber thickness is decreased. It was also observed that there is an improvement in the shunt resistance. Improvement in shunt resistance can be attributed to optimized value of i:ZnO for lower absorber thickness and less shunting paths due to a smoother absorber.}
